    The <a href="https://www.nba.com/warriors/">Warriors</a> is an NBA team that represents Oakland, California.
    Their current starting lineup is composed of <a href="https://twitter.com/StephenCurry30?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Stephen Curry</a> as the point guard,
    <a href="https://twitter.com/KlayThompson?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Klay Thompson</a> as the shooting guard,
    <a href="https://twitter.com/KDTrey5?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Kevin Durant</a> as the small forward,
    <a href="https://twitter.com/Money23Green?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Draymond Green</a> as the power forward,
    and <a href="https://twitter.com/boogiecousins?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Demarcus Cousins</a> as the center.
    They are currently the favorites to win the 2019 championship and have won three of the past four <a href="http://www.nba.com/playoffs/2018/finals">NBA Finals</a> .
    They are famous for breaking the record for most wins in a season (73)
    and having five All-Stars in their starting lineup.

    Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson form a tandem called the Splash Brothers, due to their ability to shoot from long distance. They are widely considered the best backcourt in the NBA. Stephen Curry has won two MVPs and was the first ever unanimous MVP. He and his partner Thompson have broken countless records, and Curry currently holds the record of most three pointers made in a regular season, most three pointers made in a playoff game, and most three pointers in one season, and many more. Draymond Green has won the Defensive Player of the year and is considered the heart of the team. Kevin Durant has won back-to-back Finals MVPs with the Warriors. Cousins has yet to play as a Warrior but prior to his achilles injury, he has been accepted as the best center in the league. Durant is considered the second best player in the world, with Curry arguably right under him. Klay Thompson is one of the best shooting guards in the league and the current second best shooter in the league, after Curry. Curry was given the title of best shooter of all time, with many calling unbelievably far shots as <em>Curry land</em>.
